# mongodbSocialMediaBackend

## Description

This project contains a fairly complete and comprehensive MongoDB backend for a basic social-media site that has models and routes for Users, posts, post-reactions, and 'friends'.
Motivation behind the creation was to understand how to better use Mongoose and create a noSQL database. Much of the issues came with figuring out where to start, as there are many 
more files and steps compared to the mySQL dbs I've created in the past. Like most projects, after they're done, it feels like they're really simple, it's
just getting to that point that's the tricky part. Prior to this, my Mongoose knowledge was pretty flimsy, but now I feel like I have a good grasp on the workflow
and knowledge required to working with these node modules.

## Installation

This code-base requires Node.js to work. Once that is installed, go to the directory of the code and run the command "npm install". The required packages 
will be installed and the program will be ready for use.

## Usage

To initialize the program, run "node server.js" and the routes will then be accesible through port 3001
